            <p class="text , blue",> Hello my name is <em>Benjamin Köhler</em>. I am a theoretical physicist 
                from Germany. I am learning about web development to make all 
                the cool results from my favourite field available to the public. 
                Currently, I am working as a <em>Quantum Software Engineer</em> at SaxonQ
                in my hometown Leipzig. 
            </p> 
            <p class="blue">
                I am starting with <em>HTML5</em> and <em>CSS3</em>. HTML allows me to create the general 
                layout of my website and CSS to edit the style. As such, it allows me to
                create all sorts of websites and, therefore, I consider those two languages
                the most important to learn.
            </p>
            <p class="blue">
                These are the fields in physics I worked on most:
            </p>
            <ul class="blue">
                <li>non-linear dynamics and complex systems</li>
                <li>optimal control of quantum systems</li>
                <li>condensed matter theory</li>
                <li>statistical physics</li>
                <li>quantum computing</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="black">
                Additionally, I am interested in machine learning. See <a href="documents/machine_learning_basics.pdf"> this documents</a> to learn more, 
            </p>

                When I worked at the Thorsis Technology GmbH, I developed a <a href="documents/shepard_review.pdf"> fast interpolation algorithm</a> for
                presssure data. Below you can see the results in video form:

                <pre>
<h3>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</h3>
When I heard the learn’d astronomer,
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged
                    in columns before me,
When I was shown the charts and diagrams,
                    to add, divide, and measure them,
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured
                    with much applause in the lecture-room,
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
                </pre>
